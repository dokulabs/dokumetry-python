Cohere Test Suite

This module contains a suite of tests for Cohere functionality 
using the Cohere Python library. It includes tests for various 
Cohere API endpoints such as text summarization, text generation 
with a prompt,text embeddings creation, and chat-based 
language understanding.

The tests are designed to cover different aspects of Cohere's 
capabilities and serve as a validation mechanism for the integration 
with the Doku monitoring system.

Global Cohere client and initialization are set up for the 
Cohere client and Doku monitoring.

Environment Variables:
    - COHERE_API_TOKEN: Cohere API api_key for authentication.
    - DOKU_URL: Doku URL for monitoring data submission.
    - DOKU_TOKEN: Doku authentication api_key.

Note: Ensure the environment variables are properly set before running the tests.
