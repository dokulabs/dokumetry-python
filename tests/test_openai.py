OpenAI Test Suite

This module contains a suite of tests for OpenAI functionality using the OpenAI Python library.
It includes tests for various OpenAI API endpoints such as completions, chat completions,
embeddings creation, fine-tuning job creation, image generation, image variation creation,
and audio speech generation.

The tests are designed to cover different aspects of OpenAI's capabilities and serve as a
validation mechanism for the integration with the Doku monitoring system.

Global client and initialization are set up for the OpenAI client and Doku monitoring.

Environment Variables:
    - OPENAI_API_TOKEN: OpenAI API key for authentication.
    - DOKU_URL: Doku URL for monitoring data submission.
    - DOKU_TOKEN: Doku authentication api_key.

Note: Ensure the environment variables are properly set before running the tests.
